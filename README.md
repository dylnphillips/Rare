Tokenizing the world's rarest assets.

We believe in a world where barriers to mineral property ownership are removed. Rare's unique approach to tokenizing real-world, revenue generating, rare earth mineral property has the potential to deliver more revenue and cut costs to operators, majors, and super majors alike. By automating the closing process for all parties to make closing faster, easier, and more secure than ever. Rarely are things made this simple in the oil industry, but with our solution, brokers, agents, and title companies are able to migrate to a paperless remote closing process, all while creating a seamless royalty stream to the asset holder. Closing cycles can range from 30 to 90 days, if not longer, and the amount of brokers, fraud, and middlemen in the industry can make filtering out a direct deal difficult at times. The overall reason for the development of Rarely is to create a better, more inclusive and transparent, full-stream experience for royalty producing, mineral property holders, and agents.

Key Components:

Smart Contracts: The platform would use smart contracts to tokenize mineral properties on the blockchain. These smart contracts would define the terms of the royalty stream, including the percentage of revenue that goes to the asset holder and any other parties involved in the deal.

Tokenization Engine: The tokenization engine would be responsible for creating and managing the tokens that represent the mineral properties. This engine would interface with the smart contracts to ensure that all transactions and royalties are properly recorded and executed. (Proof of Existence (e.g. Certificates, Degrees, Legal Ownership) Real World Assets (RWAs) NMA's (net mineral acres), leases, etc.

Blockchain: The platform would use a blockchain to store all transaction and royalty data. This would provide a secure and immutable record of all transactions, making it easy to audit and verify the ownership of each mineral property token.

Payment Gateway: To automate the royalty stream, the platform would include a payment gateway that would distribute revenue to the various parties involved in the deal. This gateway would interface with the smart contracts to ensure that payments are executed according to the terms of the contract.

Remote Closing System: To simplify the closing process, the platform would include a remote closing system that allows brokers, agents, and title companies to complete transactions entirely online. This system would use digital signatures and other security measures to ensure that transactions are safe and secure.

Analytics Dashboard: To provide insights into the performance of the mineral properties, the platform would include an analytics dashboard that displays real-time data on revenue, royalties, and other metrics. This dashboard would help asset holders make informed decisions about how to manage their holdings.

Overall, my goal would be to create a platform that makes it easy for operators, majors, and super majors to tokenize their mineral properties, automate the royalty stream, and streamline the closing process. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, this platform has the potential to deliver more revenue and cut costs for all parties involved.
