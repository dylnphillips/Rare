# Rare.x

Overview

This is a blockchain-based marketplace where users can buy and sell mineral properties. The platform is built on the XRPL and uses a custom smart contract to facilitate secure and efficient transactions. This README provides instructions on how to set up and use the marketplace.

We believe in a world where barriers to mineral property ownership are removed. Rare's unique approach to tokenizing real-world, revenue generating, rare earth mineral property has the potential to deliver more revenue and cut costs to operators, majors, and super majors alike. By automating the closing process for all parties to make closing faster, easier, and more secure than ever. Rare are things made this simple in the oil industry, but with our solution, brokers, agents, and title companies are able to migrate to a paperless remote closing process, all while creating a seamless royalty stream to the asset holder. Closing cycles can range from 30 to 90 days, if not longer, and the amount of brokers, fraud, and middlemen in the industry can make filtering out a direct deal difficult at times. The overall reason for the development of Rare is to create a better, more inclusive and transparent, full-stream experience for royalty producing, mineral property holders, and agents.

Prerequisites

Before using the marketplace, you will need to have the following:
A web3-enabled browser (e.g. Chrome with the MetaMask extension)
An XRPL wallet
Some XRP to use as gas fees

Installation

To use the marketplace, follow these steps:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies by running npm install.
Set up your XRPL wallet and ensure you have some XRP to use as gas fees.
Build the project by running npm run build.
Start the project by running npm start.
Open the marketplace in your web3-enabled browser.

Usage

Once you have the marketplace running in your browser, you can:
View available mineral properties for sale.
Purchase mineral properties by sending XRP to the seller's XRPL address.
Sell mineral properties by creating a new listing and specifying the price in XRP.
Withdraw proceeds from sales to your XRPL wallet.
Security
The marketplace is built with security in mind, using best practices for smart contract development and following the guidelines set forth by the XRPL community. However, please exercise caution when using the marketplace and ensure you are using a secure web3-enabled browser and XRPL wallet.

Key Components

Smart Contracts: The platform would use smart contracts to tokenize mineral properties on the blockchain. These smart contracts would define the terms of the royalty stream, including the percentage of revenue that goes to the asset holder and any other parties involved in the deal.

Tokenization Engine: The tokenization engine would be responsible for creating and managing the tokens that represent the mineral properties. This engine would interface with the smart contracts to ensure that all transactions and royalties are properly recorded and executed. (Proof of Existence (e.g. Certificates, Degrees, Legal Ownership) Real World Assets (RWAs) NMA's (net mineral acres), leases, etc.

Blockchain: The platform would use a blockchain to store all transaction and royalty data. This would provide a secure and immutable record of all transactions, making it easy to audit and verify the ownership of each mineral property token.

Payment Gateway: To automate the royalty stream, the platform would include a payment gateway that would distribute revenue to the various parties involved in the deal. This gateway would interface with the smart contracts to ensure that payments are executed according to the terms of the contract.

Remote Closing System: To simplify the closing process, the platform would include a remote closing system that allows brokers, agents, and title companies to complete transactions entirely online. This system would use digital signatures and other security measures to ensure that transactions are safe and secure.

Analytics Dashboard: To provide insights into the performance of the mineral properties, the platform would include an analytics dashboard that displays real-time data on revenue, royalties, and other metrics. This dashboard would help asset holders make informed decisions about how to manage their holdings.

The overall goal would be to create a platform that makes it easy for operators, majors, and super majors to tokenize their mineral properties, automate the royalty stream, and streamline the closing process. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, this platform has the potential to deliver more revenue and cut costs for all parties involved.
